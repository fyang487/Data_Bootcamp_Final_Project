# Data_Bootcamp_Final_Project
My final project


This project was completed by Fan Yang in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232, Data Bootcamp, Spring 2018. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. 

In particular, I have:
Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others–including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or para- phrasing thereof– has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography.

And I understand that:
Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.
I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.


Project Description
 Climate change is a widely discussed topic, but the relevant research is often not easily accessible and relatable to the layperson. This project analyzes key weather variables for four cities (New York, Shanghai, Anchorage, and Lhasa), aims to examine how weather patterns have evolved in the last two decades, and to visualize these changes in a way that makes its relevance for these cities clear.
